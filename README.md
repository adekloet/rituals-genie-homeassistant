Put the files in the folder: \config\custom_components\rituals_genie on home assistant

There is an integration for it: https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/rituals_perfume_genie
which you can still access. The HACS component files are here for whom-ever needs them for reference since it was removed from HACS June 2022.

This repository is NOT maintained but for reference only, opening issue's here will not help.
